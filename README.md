# Stanford-ML-ex3

A notebook separated in two parts for the Machine Learning course on Coursera by Andrew Ng.

## Part 1

I implement multiclass classification to identify handwritten digits.

## Part 2

I implement a neural network with feedforward propagation for the same task as above. The neural network achieves a better accuracy on the training dataset.
